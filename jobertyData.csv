Python developer,"Python, React",Beograd,Itekako,"O firmi
Itekako je domaća firma, nastala 2006. godine. Tokom prethodnih 15 godina
porasli smo do 130 ljudi, od kojih je oko trećina tu više od 5 godina.
Sarađujemo sa klijentima iz inostranstva, uglavnom iz SAD-a i Skandinavije, na
nekim velikim i nekim manjim projektima. Neki od timova su dedicated, neki su
pridruženi klijentskim developerima. Pored toga, intenzivno razvijamo i svoj
proizvod.
U okviru firme postoji odeljenje softver arhitekti, tri odeljenja developera,
jedno DevOps i jedno QA. Na čelu svakog odeljenja nalazi se Head of
department, osoba koja je zadužena za praćenje karijernog razvoja i
zadovoljstva svakog od zaposlenih. Naravno, tu je i da blagovremeno reaguje
ukoliko se javi neki problem ili nezadovoljstvo.
 Projekat
Budući da dva postojeća klijenta traže proširenje tima, trenutno nam je
potrebno još dvoje kolega sa iskustvom u Python-u.
   Jedan klijent je američki startap koji radi na rešavanju problema uznemiravanja na društvenim mrežama. Frontend je u React-u i na njemu radi trenutno dvoje naših kolega.
   Drugi klijent je britanski startap koji razvija alat za project management. Projekat je trenutno u početnoj fazi, a ideja je da se razvija u pravcu machine learning-a. Idealan kandidat pored Python- a bar u nekoj meri poznaje i React.
Za oba projekta potreban nam je neko ko je samostalan i ko bi mogao nesmetano
da komunicira sa klijentom.
 Proces selekcije
Potrudili smo se da skratimo proces selekcije što je više moguće, tako da
imamo jedan spojeni HR i tehnički intervju koji traje između 1.5 i 2h. HR deo
podrazumeva priču o prethodnom iskustvu, planovima za budućnost,
očekivanjima od firme i generalnu procenu da li bi se kandidat ukopio u
kulturu firme. Na tehničkom delu su prisutni CTO i još jedno ili dvoje
kolega koji rade u specifičnoj tehnologiji. Uključuje razgovor o tehničkim
stvarima potrebnim za poziciju i deo sa live coding-om. Ukoliko sve prođe kako
treba ostaje finalni dogovor oko finansija i konkretnih uslova.
 Benefiti

zaposlenih da samostalno organizuju svoje vreme i okruženje za rad. Radno
vreme je skoro pa u potpunosti fleksibilno, važno je samo da se ispoštuju
planirani sastanci. Kancelarije su uvek otvorene pa kome više odgovara da
prošeta do Terazija i ima uživo kontakt sa kolegama ima tu opciju. Za one
kojima više odgovara rad od kuće svakako da ima i tu mogućnost.

dana zateknu u kancelariji. Trudimo se da što je češće moguće organizujemo
neke zajedničke aktivnosti, kao što su izleti, žurke, turniri, kvizovi, a
svakog petka od 16h počinje happy hour. Takođe, pošto verujemo da su najbolji
izvor kvalitetnih kandidata naši zaposleni, za sve kolege koje nam preporuče

Angular Developer,Angular,Beograd,Geta,"We're looking to recruit a talented Angular Developer. You will have the sole
responsibility as Geta’s developer in a project with one of our clients, and
you will sit in our Belgrade office with other developers and be part of the
social environment here.The solution is a Single Page Application and deep
Angular framework knowledge is essential. Similar applications in the
portfolio have used Angular (up to v.7) and there would be benefits of using
the same in this application (maintenance). Could this be something for you?
The Belgrade team of 20 people have worked in different companies over the
past 10 years and have learned a thing or two on their way. What they’ve
learned is that trusting leadership, flexibility, and a policy against
overtime work are the most basic factors to create a good workplace. On top of
this, there are other factors that take us from “good” to “great”. Working
with new technologies and time+budget to catch up on new technologies keeps us
up to date. Being a part of a bigger company, but with freedom locally to
shape our own culture is great for ownership. Some extra vacation days,
private health insurance and massage at the office is just extra icing on the
cake.

"Android Developer, Android Test Engineer","Android, Java, Kotlin, Appium",Beograd,HOOLOOVOO,"HOOLOOVOO definitely goes mobile.
2021\. izgradili smo iOS, u 2022. godini gradimo tim koji će razvijati android
aplikacije. Imamo četiri otvorene dev pozicije – dve traže mediore i dve traže
seniore i tražimo jednu osobu da sve to testira. Platforma na kojoj radimo je
odavno mobile first, ali se mi tek ove i prošle godine uključujemo u ovaj deo
razvoja.
 Otvorene pozicije:
Developer – 2x Mid
Developer – 2x Senior
Test Engineer – 1x Mid ili Senior
_Edit: Zaposlili smo jednog mediora i jednog seniora, dakle još uvek su
otvorene dve dev pozicije i test._
 HOOLOOVOO RASTE!
U dve godine iza nas, HOOLOOVOO je porastao više nego dvostruko. Sve ovo što
HLV jeste i ceo model poslovanja i cela stabilnost kojom se hvalimo, sve to je
bilo na testu nakon što je Covid-19 počeo i taj test smo prošli bolje nego što
smo mogli da zamislimo (link). Nastavljamo da rastemo, mada rast nosi neke
momente o kojima dosta razmišljamo – kako da HOOLOOVOO ostane HOOLOOVOO i da
ne postane korporacija. To nikako nećemo. Odgovor je autonomija timova, ali
hajde da o tome pišemo još malo kasnije.
Sve ima veze sa tim što rastemo drugačije. Od početka imamo jednog klijenta,
nemamo sales i ne tražimo druge. Ideja je da, umesto da često menjamo projekte
i često počinjemo iz početka i često se prilagođavamo ovom i onom, HLV raste
kroz Kindred. Posle 2020. i dvadeset prve i svega što su donele, sigurni smo
da je model jednog ovoliko velikog klijenta zdrav i da ima logike.
 ANDROID
Devedeset posto koda je Kotlin, onih deset je Java i to je neki legacy koji
prepakujemo. Niko ne voli legacy, ali radimo na tome, sredićemo. Pošteno je da
napišemo da ima i posla koji ne voli svako. MVVM dizajn pattern. Hilt – good
to know. SDK Jetpack.
Tech Stack: Kotlin.
Testovi su nam uopšte važni, pokrivamo svaki segment.
Tech Stack: Appium ili Selenium. JUnit 5. MockK. TDD koncept.
Ako imaš vremena, pogledaj intervju sa Markusom i Sorenom. Jedan je CTO, a
drugi Head of Development u Kindredu. Pričaju o saradnji sa nama i planovima
uopšte i posebno govore o neophodnosti automatizacije.
Imamo 11000+ releasova u toku godine. “Automatizacija testova je jedini način
da dođemo do ovih brojeva.” Soren Tornlund, Head of Development @Kindred
 SUPPORT
U Kindredu nam dosta veruju i oslanjaju se na nas i mi dosta verujemo njima.
Gajimo prijateljski i profesionalan odnos. Lepo je što je sve uređeno,
definisani su procesi i procedure su jasne i nema stresa. Ima, nema mnogo.
Nema mikromenadžmenta.
Vodimo računa o ljudima zato da ne moraju da brinu bukvalno ni o čemu, da
imaju mir i fokus, da im ništa ne fali, da mogu da rade i da uživaju. Da
završe posao, odu kući i više ne misle o poslu.
Još nešto. Jasno nam je da odlično programiraš i da si odličan čovek, ali i da
si upravo to – čovek i da ti tu i tamo treba neko da ti pomogne. Da te podrži
kad bi da napustiš zonu komfora i naučiš nešto novo, kad bi da staneš jako uz
neku svoju ideju. Da ti kaže da usporiš kad previše trošiš sebe tamo gde možda
ne moraš.
 AUTONOMIJA TIMOVA
Zaslužili smo veliko poverenje klijenta, zato rastemo. Pre nekog vremena, kad
smo shvatili da ćemo uvećati broj zaposlenih, brinuli smo o jednoj stvari: šta
ako porastemo i onda HOOLOOVOO izgubi sve ono što u ovom trenutku jeste – šta
ako postanemo korporacija ili počnemo da ličimo na neku i kako da se to ne
desi? Ovo je ona priča s početka.
Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bolje razumeš sve i da razumeš ovu ilustraciju, pročitaj tekst (link) koji
je u stvari osnova HOOLOOVOO-a i Framework.
Da bismo učinili timove autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine
smo uveli timski budžet. Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i
zavisi od broja članova tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team
building, edukacija, stave pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.
 BENEFITI
Napisali smo ozbiljan tekst o benefitima u HOOLOOVOO-u (link). Malo je duži,
ne previše, ali onda ćeš znati sve o odmorima, o bolovanjima, o timskim
budžetima…
Verovatno najvažniji segmenti tiču se zdravstvenog paketa, paketa za trudnice
ukoliko planiraš bebu i paketa koji kači slobodno vreme.
 PRIJAVI SE!
Ako si razmišljao/la o promeni posla ili ti se nekad učinilo da je HOOLOOVOO
mesto gde bi mogao/la da radiš neke super stvari, sad je trenutak da nam se
javiš. Piši nam mail na pokidaj@hooloovoo.rs. Trebaš nam.","https://www.joberty.rs/posao/android-developer,-android-test-engineer/hooloovoo/7914"

Senior Software Engineer (JS/Web Extensions),"JavaScript, HTML",Beograd,"CPA Global, Part of Clarivate","Clarivate™ is a global leader in providing solutions to accelerate the
lifecycle of innovation. Our bold mission is to help customers solve some of
the world’s most complex problems by providing actionable information and
insights that reduce the time from new ideas to life-changing inventions in
the areas of science and intellectual property. We help customers discover,
protect and commercialize their inventions using our trusted subscription and
technology-based solutions coupled with deep domain expertise.
We now have more than 8,500 colleagues in over 40 countries worldwide, and we
work with over 200 partners to deliver value and success for our customers.
Today, Clarivate is a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker NYSE:CLVT.
Clarivate is committed to building, nurturing, and developing a diverse
culture of belonging where new colleagues can bring their authentic self to
work every day! Join us!
The EndNote suite of tools help millions of people around the world access,
organise and publish their research.
 Our Team
   We're a small and highly talented team. We aim to accelerate the speed at which research is undertaken and published. We take pride in our culture where a 'can do' attitude is more valued than any process. We like to follow our curiosity and push boundaries. We put a strong emphasis on working independently and creatively, finding solutions to complex problems in an iterative way.
 The Role
   As a senior software engineer you will become an integral part of our small and highly talented team. You’ll be joining our team to improve reliability and performance and add new features to our products. We encourage people to work across streams, but your focus will be the EndNote Click browser extension which serves over 1 Million people.
   Working closely alongside Product and UX, you will play a central role in building the future of our products and exploring the technologies we use. We are looking for a user focused software engineer passionate about building EndNote in a way that enables end-users to conduct and publish their research.
   Our developer experience is super important too, so building a maintainable codebase that’s fun to work with is part of the agenda too!
 What we don’t require
   Our suite of products that use web technology include websites, browser extensions, bookmarklets, and plugins for word processors. Most engineers we’ve hired have been brand new to most of these. We’ve gotten pretty good at getting engineers up to speed quickly, so all you need is a solid foundation in web technologies (i.e. JavaScript, HTML, etc.).
 Cool things you'll be working on
   Most of our products touch the lives of millions of people. For example, there aren’t many engineers that have built browser extensions that reach large audiences. That means that a lot of the challenges we face are new and are often unique. If you like being creative and solving problems this role is likely a good fit.
   You’ll be working on both maintenance and feature development (likely in that order to start) of the EndNote Click browser extension. We hope you’ll want to take a step back and think about big-picture solutions. We'd want you to participate in discussions about the future of the projects, e.g. WebAssembly could help us, or evaluating changes in Chrome API's or rethinking approaches to debugging.
 Requirements
   You value a culture where the quality of code (maintainability, extensibility, performance) is as important as time-to-market
   A big picture focus when developing new applications and features
   A love for learning new things and applying them to your work
   10+ years experience developing, releasing and maintaining complex JavaScript applications
   Comfortable with version control systems (we use git)
   Excellent written and spoken English
 Day-to-day responsibilities
   Working with a small team to see how we can leverage web technologies as we push EndNote toward the future
   Continue our effort to push toward a fast, beautiful, maintainable, portable codebase across our suite of products
   Design and deploy analytics to see how code is performing and being used in the wild
   Writing unit tests where they add value, and removing or updating those that do not
 What We Can Offer You
   Paid lunch
   Private health insurance
   FitPass card
   Company bicycles for rent free of charge
   Access to My Learning platform
   Access to Virgin Pulse platform

 HOOLOOVOO raste!
U proteklih godinu dana i malo preko (od 1. juna 2020. godine), zaposlili smo
više od 40 novih kolega. Više od polovine – seniora. Sve ovo što HOOLOOVOO
jeste i ceo model poslovanja i cela stabilnost kojom se hvalimo, sve to je
bilo na testu prošle godine i taj test smo prošli bolje nego što smo mogli da
zamislimo (link). Nastavljamo da rastemo i to je strava, mada rast nosi neke
momente o kojima dosta razmišljamo – kako da HOOLOOVOO ostane HOOLOOVOO i da
ne postane korporacija. To nikako nećemo. Odgovor je autonomija timova, ali
hajde da o tome pišemo malo kasnije.
Zašto je ovo važno i zašto smo sve ovo napisali ovoliko visoko u oglasu? Zato
što smo hteli da odmah znaš da se mega cimamo da ljudima bude dobro. Neki
ljudi koji su bili ovde kad je HOOLOOVOO počinjao, još uvek su ovde, a
kapacitet su da odu gde god požele. O benefitima i sličnim stvarima pročitaćeš
za minut.
Sve ima veze i sa tim što rastemo drugačije od drugih. Od početka imamo jednog
klijenta, nemamo sales i ne tražimo druge. Ideja je da, umesto da često
menjamo projekte i često počinjemo iz početka i često se prilagođavamo ovom i
onom, HOOLOOVOO raste kroz Kindred. Posle cele 2020. i svega što je donela,
sigurni smo da je model jednog ovoliko velikog klijenta zdrav i da ima logike.
 Frontend
Backend smo podelili u mikroservise i to skaliramo, to je ok – veliki broj
mikroservisa znači veliki broj funkcionalnosti i veliki broj timova koji non-
stop isporučuju nove.
   Kako onda skalabilan frontend?
   Kako da ga podelimo u nezavisne timove?
   Kako da svi oni mogu da release-uju svoje izmene?
   Kako da frontend isporučuje funkcionalnosti istom dinamikom kao backend?
Tech Stack: React. Javascript.
 Support
U Kindredu nam dosta veruju i oslanjaju se na nas i mi dosta verujemo njima.
Gajimo prijateljski i profesionalan odnos. Lepo je što je sve uređeno,
definisani su procesi i procedure su jasne i nema stresa. Ima, nema mnogo.
Nema mikromenadžmenta.
Vodimo računa o ljudima zato da ne moraju da brinu bukvalno ni o čemu, da
imaju mir i fokus, da im ništa ne fali, da mogu da rade i da uživaju. Da
završe posao, odu kući i više ne misle o poslu.
Još nešto. Jasno nam je da odlično programiraš i da si odličan čovek, ali i da
si upravo to – čovek i da ti tu i tamo treba neko da ti pomogne. Da te podrži
kad bi da napustiš zonu komfora i naučiš nešto novo, kad bi da staneš jako uz
neku svoju ideju. Da ti kaže da usporiš kad previše trošiš sebe tamo gde možda
ne moraš.
 Autonomija timova
Zaslužili smo veliko poverenje klijenta, zato rastemo. Pre nekog vremena, kad
smo shvatili da ćemo uvećati broj zaposlenih, brinuli smo o jednoj stvari: šta
ako porastemo i onda HOOLOOVOO izgubi sve ono što u ovom trenutku jeste – šta
ako postanemo korporacija ili počnemo da ličimo na neku i kako da se to ne
desi? Ovo je ona priča s početka.
Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bismo učinili timove autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine
smo uveli timski budžet. Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i
zavisi od broja članova tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team
building, edukacija, stave pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.
 Benefiti
Napisali smo ozbiljan tekst o benefitima u HOOLOOVOO-u (link). Malo je duži,
ne previše, ali onda ćeš znati sve o odmorima, o bolovanjima, o timskim
budžetima… Verovatno najvažniji segmenti tiču se zdravstvenog paketa, paketa
za trudnice ukoliko planiraš bebu i paketa koji kači slobodno vreme.
PRIJAVI SE!
Ako si razmišljao/la o promeni posla ili ti se nekad učinilo da je HOOLOOVOO
mesto gde bi mogao/la da radiš neke super stvari, sad je trenutak da nam se

Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bismo učinili timove autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine
smo uveli timski budžet. Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i
zavisi od broja članova tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team
building, edukacija, stave pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.

ne previše, ali onda ćeš znati sve o odmorima, o bolovanjima, o timskim

Python developer,"Python, React",Beograd,Itekako,"O firmi
Itekako je domaća firma, nastala 2006. godine. Tokom prethodnih 15 godina
porasli smo do 130 ljudi, od kojih je oko trećina tu više od 5 godina.
Sarađujemo sa klijentima iz inostranstva, uglavnom iz SAD-a i Skandinavije, na
nekim velikim i nekim manjim projektima. Neki od timova su dedicated, neki su
pridruženi klijentskim developerima. Pored toga, intenzivno razvijamo i svoj
proizvod.
U okviru firme postoji odeljenje softver arhitekti, tri odeljenja developera,
jedno DevOps i jedno QA. Na čelu svakog odeljenja nalazi se Head of
department, osoba koja je zadužena za praćenje karijernog razvoja i
zadovoljstva svakog od zaposlenih. Naravno, tu je i da blagovremeno reaguje
ukoliko se javi neki problem ili nezadovoljstvo.
 Projekat
Budući da dva postojeća klijenta traže proširenje tima, trenutno nam je
potrebno još dvoje kolega sa iskustvom u Python-u.
   Jedan klijent je američki startap koji radi na rešavanju problema uznemiravanja na društvenim mrežama. Frontend je u React-u i na njemu radi trenutno dvoje naših kolega.
   Drugi klijent je britanski startap koji razvija alat za project management. Projekat je trenutno u početnoj fazi, a ideja je da se razvija u pravcu machine learning-a. Idealan kandidat pored Python- a bar u nekoj meri poznaje i React.
Za oba projekta potreban nam je neko ko je samostalan i ko bi mogao nesmetano
da komunicira sa klijentom.
 Proces selekcije
Potrudili smo se da skratimo proces selekcije što je više moguće, tako da
imamo jedan spojeni HR i tehnički intervju koji traje između 1.5 i 2h. HR deo
podrazumeva priču o prethodnom iskustvu, planovima za budućnost,
očekivanjima od firme i generalnu procenu da li bi se kandidat ukopio u
kulturu firme. Na tehničkom delu su prisutni CTO i još jedno ili dvoje
kolega koji rade u specifičnoj tehnologiji. Uključuje razgovor o tehničkim
stvarima potrebnim za poziciju i deo sa live coding-om. Ukoliko sve prođe kako
treba ostaje finalni dogovor oko finansija i konkretnih uslova.
 Benefiti
Jedna od osnovnih karakteristika rada u Itekako jeste fleksibilnost i sloboda
zaposlenih da samostalno organizuju svoje vreme i okruženje za rad. Radno
vreme je skoro pa u potpunosti fleksibilno, važno je samo da se ispoštuju
planirani sastanci. Kancelarije su uvek otvorene pa kome više odgovara da
prošeta do Terazija i ima uživo kontakt sa kolegama ima tu opciju. Za one
kojima više odgovara rad od kuće svakako da ima i tu mogućnost.

na godišnjem nivou. Organizujemo ručak dva puta nedeljno za kolege koje se tog
dana zateknu u kancelariji. Trudimo se da što je češće moguće organizujemo
neke zajedničke aktivnosti, kao što su izleti, žurke, turniri, kvizovi, a
svakog petka od 16h počinje happy hour. Takođe, pošto verujemo da su najbolji
izvor kvalitetnih kandidata naši zaposleni, za sve kolege koje nam preporuče
nekog svog prijatelja mediora ili seniora kog zaposlimo, obezbeđeni su vredni
novčani bonusi. Veoma nam je važan tehnički napredak tako da često

responsibility as Geta’s developer in a project with one of our clients, and
you will sit in our Belgrade office with other developers and be part of the
social environment here.The solution is a Single Page Application and deep
Angular framework knowledge is essential. Similar applications in the
portfolio have used Angular (up to v.7) and there would be benefits of using
the same in this application (maintenance). Could this be something for you?
The Belgrade team of 20 people have worked in different companies over the
past 10 years and have learned a thing or two on their way. What they’ve
learned is that trusting leadership, flexibility, and a policy against
overtime work are the most basic factors to create a good workplace. On top of
this, there are other factors that take us from “good” to “great”. Working
with new technologies and time+budget to catch up on new technologies keeps us
up to date. Being a part of a bigger company, but with freedom locally to
shape our own culture is great for ownership. Some extra vacation days,
private health insurance and massage at the office is just extra icing on the
cake.

"Android Developer, Android Test Engineer","Android, Java, Kotlin, Appium",Beograd,HOOLOOVOO,"HOOLOOVOO definitely goes mobile.
2021\. izgradili smo iOS, u 2022. godini gradimo tim koji će razvijati android
aplikacije. Imamo četiri otvorene dev pozicije – dve traže mediore i dve traže
seniore i tražimo jednu osobu da sve to testira. Platforma na kojoj radimo je
odavno mobile first, ali se mi tek ove i prošle godine uključujemo u ovaj deo
razvoja.
 Otvorene pozicije:
Developer – 2x Mid
Developer – 2x Senior
Test Engineer – 1x Mid ili Senior
_Edit: Zaposlili smo jednog mediora i jednog seniora, dakle još uvek su
otvorene dve dev pozicije i test._
 HOOLOOVOO RASTE!
U dve godine iza nas, HOOLOOVOO je porastao više nego dvostruko. Sve ovo što
HLV jeste i ceo model poslovanja i cela stabilnost kojom se hvalimo, sve to je
bilo na testu nakon što je Covid-19 počeo i taj test smo prošli bolje nego što
smo mogli da zamislimo (link). Nastavljamo da rastemo, mada rast nosi neke
momente o kojima dosta razmišljamo – kako da HOOLOOVOO ostane HOOLOOVOO i da
ne postane korporacija. To nikako nećemo. Odgovor je autonomija timova, ali
hajde da o tome pišemo još malo kasnije.
Sve ima veze sa tim što rastemo drugačije. Od početka imamo jednog klijenta,
nemamo sales i ne tražimo druge. Ideja je da, umesto da često menjamo projekte
i često počinjemo iz početka i često se prilagođavamo ovom i onom, HLV raste
kroz Kindred. Posle 2020. i dvadeset prve i svega što su donele, sigurni smo
da je model jednog ovoliko velikog klijenta zdrav i da ima logike.
 ANDROID
Devedeset posto koda je Kotlin, onih deset je Java i to je neki legacy koji
prepakujemo. Niko ne voli legacy, ali radimo na tome, sredićemo. Pošteno je da
napišemo da ima i posla koji ne voli svako. MVVM dizajn pattern. Hilt – good
to know. SDK Jetpack.
Tech Stack: Kotlin.
Testovi su nam uopšte važni, pokrivamo svaki segment.
Tech Stack: Appium ili Selenium. JUnit 5. MockK. TDD koncept.
Ako imaš vremena, pogledaj intervju sa Markusom i Sorenom. Jedan je CTO, a
drugi Head of Development u Kindredu. Pričaju o saradnji sa nama i planovima
uopšte i posebno govore o neophodnosti automatizacije.
Imamo 11000+ releasova u toku godine. “Automatizacija testova je jedini način
da dođemo do ovih brojeva.” Soren Tornlund, Head of Development @Kindred
 SUPPORT
U Kindredu nam dosta veruju i oslanjaju se na nas i mi dosta verujemo njima.
Gajimo prijateljski i profesionalan odnos. Lepo je što je sve uređeno,
definisani su procesi i procedure su jasne i nema stresa. Ima, nema mnogo.
Nema mikromenadžmenta.
Vodimo računa o ljudima zato da ne moraju da brinu bukvalno ni o čemu, da
imaju mir i fokus, da im ništa ne fali, da mogu da rade i da uživaju. Da
završe posao, odu kući i više ne misle o poslu.
Još nešto. Jasno nam je da odlično programiraš i da si odličan čovek, ali i da
si upravo to – čovek i da ti tu i tamo treba neko da ti pomogne. Da te podrži
kad bi da napustiš zonu komfora i naučiš nešto novo, kad bi da staneš jako uz
neku svoju ideju. Da ti kaže da usporiš kad previše trošiš sebe tamo gde možda
ne moraš.
 AUTONOMIJA TIMOVA
Zaslužili smo veliko poverenje klijenta, zato rastemo. Pre nekog vremena, kad
smo shvatili da ćemo uvećati broj zaposlenih, brinuli smo o jednoj stvari: šta
ako porastemo i onda HOOLOOVOO izgubi sve ono što u ovom trenutku jeste – šta
ako postanemo korporacija ili počnemo da ličimo na neku i kako da se to ne
desi? Ovo je ona priča s početka.
Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bolje razumeš sve i da razumeš ovu ilustraciju, pročitaj tekst (link) koji
je u stvari osnova HOOLOOVOO-a i Framework.
Da bismo učinili timove autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine
smo uveli timski budžet. Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i
zavisi od broja članova tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team
building, edukacija, stave pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.
 BENEFITI

Senior Software Engineer (JS/Web Extensions),"JavaScript, HTML",Beograd,"CPA Global, Part of Clarivate","Clarivate™ is a global leader in providing solutions to accelerate the
lifecycle of innovation. Our bold mission is to help customers solve some of
the world’s most complex problems by providing actionable information and
insights that reduce the time from new ideas to life-changing inventions in
the areas of science and intellectual property. We help customers discover,
protect and commercialize their inventions using our trusted subscription and
technology-based solutions coupled with deep domain expertise.
We now have more than 8,500 colleagues in over 40 countries worldwide, and we
work with over 200 partners to deliver value and success for our customers.
Today, Clarivate is a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker NYSE:CLVT.
Clarivate is committed to building, nurturing, and developing a diverse
culture of belonging where new colleagues can bring their authentic self to
work every day! Join us!
The EndNote suite of tools help millions of people around the world access,
organise and publish their research.
 Our Team
   We're a small and highly talented team. We aim to accelerate the speed at which research is undertaken and published. We take pride in our culture where a 'can do' attitude is more valued than any process. We like to follow our curiosity and push boundaries. We put a strong emphasis on working independently and creatively, finding solutions to complex problems in an iterative way.
 The Role
   As a senior software engineer you will become an integral part of our small and highly talented team. You’ll be joining our team to improve reliability and performance and add new features to our products. We encourage people to work across streams, but your focus will be the EndNote Click browser extension which serves over 1 Million people.
   Working closely alongside Product and UX, you will play a central role in building the future of our products and exploring the technologies we use. We are looking for a user focused software engineer passionate about building EndNote in a way that enables end-users to conduct and publish their research.
   Our developer experience is super important too, so building a maintainable codebase that’s fun to work with is part of the agenda too!
 What we don’t require
   Our suite of products that use web technology include websites, browser extensions, bookmarklets, and plugins for word processors. Most engineers we’ve hired have been brand new to most of these. We’ve gotten pretty good at getting engineers up to speed quickly, so all you need is a solid foundation in web technologies (i.e. JavaScript, HTML, etc.).
 Cool things you'll be working on
   Most of our products touch the lives of millions of people. For example, there aren’t many engineers that have built browser extensions that reach large audiences. That means that a lot of the challenges we face are new and are often unique. If you like being creative and solving problems this role is likely a good fit.
   You’ll be working on both maintenance and feature development (likely in that order to start) of the EndNote Click browser extension. We hope you’ll want to take a step back and think about big-picture solutions. We'd want you to participate in discussions about the future of the projects, e.g. WebAssembly could help us, or evaluating changes in Chrome API's or rethinking approaches to debugging.
 Requirements
   You value a culture where the quality of code (maintainability, extensibility, performance) is as important as time-to-market
   A big picture focus when developing new applications and features
   A love for learning new things and applying them to your work
   10+ years experience developing, releasing and maintaining complex JavaScript applications
   Comfortable with version control systems (we use git)
   Excellent written and spoken English
 Day-to-day responsibilities
   Working with a small team to see how we can leverage web technologies as we push EndNote toward the future
   Continue our effort to push toward a fast, beautiful, maintainable, portable codebase across our suite of products
   Design and deploy analytics to see how code is performing and being used in the wild
   Writing unit tests where they add value, and removing or updating those that do not
 What We Can Offer You
   Paid lunch
   Private health insurance
   FitPass card
   Company bicycles for rent free of charge
   Access to My Learning platform
   Access to Virgin Pulse platform

 HOOLOOVOO raste!
U proteklih godinu dana i malo preko (od 1. juna 2020. godine), zaposlili smo
više od 40 novih kolega. Više od polovine – seniora. Sve ovo što HOOLOOVOO
jeste i ceo model poslovanja i cela stabilnost kojom se hvalimo, sve to je
bilo na testu prošle godine i taj test smo prošli bolje nego što smo mogli da
zamislimo (link). Nastavljamo da rastemo i to je strava, mada rast nosi neke
momente o kojima dosta razmišljamo – kako da HOOLOOVOO ostane HOOLOOVOO i da
ne postane korporacija. To nikako nećemo. Odgovor je autonomija timova, ali
hajde da o tome pišemo malo kasnije.
Zašto je ovo važno i zašto smo sve ovo napisali ovoliko visoko u oglasu? Zato
što smo hteli da odmah znaš da se mega cimamo da ljudima bude dobro. Neki
ljudi koji su bili ovde kad je HOOLOOVOO počinjao, još uvek su ovde, a
kapacitet su da odu gde god požele. O benefitima i sličnim stvarima pročitaćeš
za minut.
Sve ima veze i sa tim što rastemo drugačije od drugih. Od početka imamo jednog
klijenta, nemamo sales i ne tražimo druge. Ideja je da, umesto da često
menjamo projekte i često počinjemo iz početka i često se prilagođavamo ovom i
onom, HOOLOOVOO raste kroz Kindred. Posle cele 2020. i svega što je donela,
sigurni smo da je model jednog ovoliko velikog klijenta zdrav i da ima logike.
 Frontend
Backend smo podelili u mikroservise i to skaliramo, to je ok – veliki broj
mikroservisa znači veliki broj funkcionalnosti i veliki broj timova koji non-
stop isporučuju nove.
   Kako onda skalabilan frontend?
   Kako da ga podelimo u nezavisne timove?
   Kako da svi oni mogu da release-uju svoje izmene?
   Kako da frontend isporučuje funkcionalnosti istom dinamikom kao backend?
Tech Stack: React. Javascript.
 Support
U Kindredu nam dosta veruju i oslanjaju se na nas i mi dosta verujemo njima.
Gajimo prijateljski i profesionalan odnos. Lepo je što je sve uređeno,
definisani su procesi i procedure su jasne i nema stresa. Ima, nema mnogo.
Nema mikromenadžmenta.
Vodimo računa o ljudima zato da ne moraju da brinu bukvalno ni o čemu, da
imaju mir i fokus, da im ništa ne fali, da mogu da rade i da uživaju. Da
završe posao, odu kući i više ne misle o poslu.
Još nešto. Jasno nam je da odlično programiraš i da si odličan čovek, ali i da
si upravo to – čovek i da ti tu i tamo treba neko da ti pomogne. Da te podrži
kad bi da napustiš zonu komfora i naučiš nešto novo, kad bi da staneš jako uz
neku svoju ideju. Da ti kaže da usporiš kad previše trošiš sebe tamo gde možda
ne moraš.
 Autonomija timova
Zaslužili smo veliko poverenje klijenta, zato rastemo. Pre nekog vremena, kad
smo shvatili da ćemo uvećati broj zaposlenih, brinuli smo o jednoj stvari: šta
ako porastemo i onda HOOLOOVOO izgubi sve ono što u ovom trenutku jeste – šta
ako postanemo korporacija ili počnemo da ličimo na neku i kako da se to ne
desi? Ovo je ona priča s početka.
Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bismo učinili timove autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine
smo uveli timski budžet. Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i
zavisi od broja članova tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team
building, edukacija, stave pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.
 Benefiti
Napisali smo ozbiljan tekst o benefitima u HOOLOOVOO-u (link). Malo je duži,
ne previše, ali onda ćeš znati sve o odmorima, o bolovanjima, o timskim
budžetima… Verovatno najvažniji segmenti tiču se zdravstvenog paketa, paketa
za trudnice ukoliko planiraš bebu i paketa koji kači slobodno vreme.
PRIJAVI SE!
Ako si razmišljao/la o promeni posla ili ti se nekad učinilo da je HOOLOOVOO
mesto gde bi mogao/la da radiš neke super stvari, sad je trenutak da nam se
javiš. Piši nam mail na pokidaj@hooloovoo.rs. Trebaš nam.",https://www.joberty.rs/posao/frontend-developer/hooloovoo/7635

U Kindredu nam dosta veruju i oslanjaju se na nas i mi dosta verujemo njima.
Gajimo prijateljski i profesionalan odnos. Lepo je što je sve uređeno,
definisani su procesi i procedure su jasne i nema stresa. Ima, nema mnogo.
Nema mikromenadžmenta.
Vodimo računa o ljudima zato da ne moraju da brinu bukvalno ni o čemu, da
imaju mir i fokus, da im ništa ne fali, da mogu da rade i da uživaju. Da
završe posao, odu kući i više ne misle o poslu.
Još nešto. Jasno nam je da odlično programiraš i da si odličan čovek, ali i da
si upravo to – čovek i da ti tu i tamo treba neko da ti pomogne. Da te podrži
kad bi da napustiš zonu komfora i naučiš nešto novo, kad bi da staneš jako uz
neku svoju ideju. Da ti kaže da usporiš kad previše trošiš sebe tamo gde možda
ne moraš.
 Autonomija timova
Zaslužili smo veliko poverenje klijenta, zato rastemo. Pre nekog vremena, kad
smo shvatili da ćemo uvećati broj zaposlenih, brinuli smo o jednoj stvari: šta
ako porastemo i onda HOOLOOVOO izgubi sve ono što u ovom trenutku jeste – šta
ako postanemo korporacija ili počnemo da ličimo na neku i kako da se to ne
desi? Ovo je ona priča s početka.
Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bismo učinili timove autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine
smo uveli timski budžet. Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i
zavisi od broja članova tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team
building, edukacija, stave pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.
 Benefiti
Napisali smo ozbiljan tekst o benefitima u HOOLOOVOO-u (link). Malo je duži,
ne previše, ali onda ćeš znati sve o odmorima, o bolovanjima, o timskim
budžetima… Verovatno najvažniji segmenti tiču se zdravstvenog paketa, paketa
za trudnice ukoliko planiraš bebu i paketa koji kači slobodno vreme.
PRIJAVI SE!
Ako si razmišljao/la o promeni posla ili ti se nekad učinilo da je HOOLOOVOO
mesto gde bi mogao/la da radiš neke super stvari, sad je trenutak da nam se
javiš. Piši nam mail na pokidaj@hooloovoo.rs. Trebaš nam.",https://www.joberty.rs/posao/backend-developer/hooloovoo/7634
Big Data Developer,"AWS, Docker, Java, Kafka, Scala, Spring, SQL",Beograd,HOOLOOVOO,"HOOLOOVOO traži nekog ko ume Javu ili Scalu i Spark. I Spring Boot. Napisali
smo dalje u oglasu ceo tech stack. Tim broji 18 ljudi mid/senior nivoa, u
Beogradu radi pet - tri developera i dva DevOpsa. Tim je ključan za razvoj
responsible gaminga – Player Safety, Anti Money Laundering itd.
GDPR smo rešili. Realtime releasovi (quick approval, GitOps principals, K8s,
Jenkins). High quality secure code alati (peer core reviews, JaCoCo, SpotBugs,
SonarCube, X-Ray vulnerability scans). Sve te fensi stvari, strava tehnologije
i testna okruženja da na njima eksperimentišemo. Oglas je malo duži, ali šira
slika je ključ. Trebaće ti minut-dva, a važno je da pročitaš ceo tekst.
 HOOLOOVOO RASTE!
U proteklih godinu dana i malo preko (od 1. juna 2020. godine), zaposlili smo
više od 40 novih kolega. Više od polovine – seniora. Sve ovo što HOOLOOVOO
jeste i ceo model poslovanja i cela stabilnost kojom se hvalimo, sve to je
bilo na testu prošle godine i taj test smo prošli bolje nego što smo mogli da
zamislimo (link). Nastavljamo da rastemo i to je strava, mada rast nosi neke
momente o kojima dosta razmišljamo – kako da HOOLOOVOO ostane HOOLOOVOO i da
ne postane korporacija. To nikako nećemo. Odgovor je autonomija timova, ali
hajde da o tome pišemo malo kasnije.
Zašto je ovo važno i zašto smo sve ovo napisali ovoliko visoko u oglasu? Zato
što smo hteli da odmah znaš da se mega cimamo da ljudima bude dobro. Neki
ljudi koji su bili ovde kad je HOOLOOVOO počinjao, još uvek su ovde, a
kapacitet su da odu gde god požele. O benefitima i sličnim stvarima pročitaćeš
za minut.
Sve ima veze i sa tim što rastemo drugačije od drugih. Od početka imamo jednog
klijenta, nemamo sales i ne tražimo druge. Ideja je da, umesto da često
menjamo projekte i često počinjemo iz početka i često se prilagođavamo ovom i
onom, HOOLOOVOO raste kroz Kindred. Posle cele 2020. i svega što je donela,
sigurni smo da je model jednog ovoliko velikog klijenta zdrav i da ima logike.

resurse, smanje troškove i pritisak na druge komponente. Alerts setting &
tracking. Pratimo ceo lifecycle komponenti, obezbeđujemo visok availability i
fault tolerance za ceo pipeline flow. Ovo je verovatno oglas u kom smo
napisali najviše ovih engleskih reči… Lifecycle… Nema veze.

Product (UX/UI) Dizajner,Ostalo,Remote,Made Tight,"Made Tight is a small product design studio, based in Belgrade. We work with
startups, growing scale-ups, and established brands to help them design the
perfect user experience for their products. We work with a small number of
clients and act as their design partners (we are their only design team). We
don’t work with freelancers unless they are full-time freelancing with us.
 What matters most
   UX Skills - user /competitor research, wireframing, prototyping
   Experience with turning complex problems into simple and engaging customer experiences
   Experience with working on the design systems and creating one from scratch
   UI skills - you should have experience with visual design and understand how paddings, margins, typography work together; and a portfolio that proves that.
   We’re looking for a team player who likes to get involved and take ownership. We don’t like to micro-manage.
   Enjoying working in a small, distributed team.
   Feeling comfortable with meeting with clients and contributing to the overall project.
   Comfortable with delivering solutions to clients - not endless drafts.
   Experience with Figma
   Fluent in spoken and written English
 Projects you’ll be working on
   Building digital products from an idea stage to ready-for-the-market product, or taking an existing product and redoing UX and UI.
   Technology startups from a variety of industries - fintech, Saas products, Marketing automation tools, HR tools.
   You will be involved in both - product design and website projects, collaborating with our external partners, and sometimes leading the direction of a project. (We often work on marketing sites for products we build, whos better to lead that project but the person who made the product in the first place)
 Product designers day-to-day look like this:
   Designing engaging user experiences on Figma
   Building clickable prototypes and testing product performance
   Maintaining existing or newly created design system
   Participating and sometimes leading design workshops and ideation sessions with clients, basically you will be the designer on that project.
 The ideal candidate
The role is suitable for a person with a preference for UI design, but they
should also be able to think about the best UX and user flows. We care about
the details and user needs equality, and we hope you do, too.
Deep product thinking and natural curiosity about how to engage users is a
huge plus.
Ideally, we’re looking for someone who’s got a few years of experience in
building digital products, if you are a junior designer, you _probably ain't
gonna cut it_. We have other positions open, check those.
The ideal candidate would read everything we wrote above, and for the sake of
knowing that, the candidate would send us a designer meme attached with
portfolio in the application email.
 What we offer
   Competitive salary
   The opportunity to work on world-class innovative products and have your work featured and recognized in the industry.
   Work from wherever you want - We are not getting back to the office.
   Flexible working hours (we have some mandatory meetings though)

Senior Software Engineer (JS/Web Extensions),"JavaScript, HTML",Beograd,"CPA Global, Part of Clarivate","Clarivate™ is a global leader in providing solutions to accelerate the
lifecycle of innovation. Our bold mission is to help customers solve some of
the world’s most complex problems by providing actionable information and
insights that reduce the time from new ideas to life-changing inventions in
the areas of science and intellectual property. We help customers discover,
protect and commercialize their inventions using our trusted subscription and
technology-based solutions coupled with deep domain expertise.
We now have more than 8,500 colleagues in over 40 countries worldwide, and we
work with over 200 partners to deliver value and success for our customers.
Today, Clarivate is a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker NYSE:CLVT.
Clarivate is committed to building, nurturing, and developing a diverse
culture of belonging where new colleagues can bring their authentic self to
work every day! Join us!
The EndNote suite of tools help millions of people around the world access,
organise and publish their research.
 Our Team
   We're a small and highly talented team. We aim to accelerate the speed at which research is undertaken and published. We take pride in our culture where a 'can do' attitude is more valued than any process. We like to follow our curiosity and push boundaries. We put a strong emphasis on working independently and creatively, finding solutions to complex problems in an iterative way.
 The Role
   As a senior software engineer you will become an integral part of our small and highly talented team. You’ll be joining our team to improve reliability and performance and add new features to our products. We encourage people to work across streams, but your focus will be the EndNote Click browser extension which serves over 1 Million people.
   Working closely alongside Product and UX, you will play a central role in building the future of our products and exploring the technologies we use. We are looking for a user focused software engineer passionate about building EndNote in a way that enables end-users to conduct and publish their research.
   Our developer experience is super important too, so building a maintainable codebase that’s fun to work with is part of the agenda too!
 What we don’t require
   Our suite of products that use web technology include websites, browser extensions, bookmarklets, and plugins for word processors. Most engineers we’ve hired have been brand new to most of these. We’ve gotten pretty good at getting engineers up to speed quickly, so all you need is a solid foundation in web technologies (i.e. JavaScript, HTML, etc.).
 Cool things you'll be working on
   Most of our products touch the lives of millions of people. For example, there aren’t many engineers that have built browser extensions that reach large audiences. That means that a lot of the challenges we face are new and are often unique. If you like being creative and solving problems this role is likely a good fit.
   You’ll be working on both maintenance and feature development (likely in that order to start) of the EndNote Click browser extension. We hope you’ll want to take a step back and think about big-picture solutions. We'd want you to participate in discussions about the future of the projects, e.g. WebAssembly could help us, or evaluating changes in Chrome API's or rethinking approaches to debugging.
 Requirements
   You value a culture where the quality of code (maintainability, extensibility, performance) is as important as time-to-market
   A big picture focus when developing new applications and features
   A love for learning new things and applying them to your work
   10+ years experience developing, releasing and maintaining complex JavaScript applications
   Comfortable with version control systems (we use git)
   Excellent written and spoken English
 Day-to-day responsibilities
   Working with a small team to see how we can leverage web technologies as we push EndNote toward the future
   Continue our effort to push toward a fast, beautiful, maintainable, portable codebase across our suite of products
   Design and deploy analytics to see how code is performing and being used in the wild
   Writing unit tests where they add value, and removing or updating those that do not
 What We Can Offer You

   FitPass card
   Company bicycles for rent free of charge
   Access to My Learning platform
   Access to Virgin Pulse platform

Frontend Developer,"ReactJS, JavaScript",Beograd,HOOLOOVOO,"HOOLOOVOO traži nekog ko ume Javascript. Otvorili smo određen broj pozicija u
nekoliko različitih timova, sve traže iskusne programere – mid i seniore.
Oglas je malo duži, kao i sve što napišemo, trebaće ti minut-dva, a važno je
da pročitaš ceo tekst.
Formiramo i nekoliko novih timova, pa imamo mesta za tebe i tvoju ekipu, ako
bi da dovedeš drugare da radite zajedno. Zašto da ne, svakako nam trebaju
ljudi, a vi biste da ostanete na okupu. Win-win. Uopšte, naša strategija rasta
počiva na izgradnji celih timova. Trenutno ih imamo nekoliko i gradimo nove.
 HOOLOOVOO raste!
U proteklih godinu dana i malo preko (od 1. juna 2020. godine), zaposlili smo
više od 40 novih kolega. Više od polovine – seniora. Sve ovo što HOOLOOVOO
jeste i ceo model poslovanja i cela stabilnost kojom se hvalimo, sve to je
bilo na testu prošle godine i taj test smo prošli bolje nego što smo mogli da
zamislimo (link). Nastavljamo da rastemo i to je strava, mada rast nosi neke
momente o kojima dosta razmišljamo – kako da HOOLOOVOO ostane HOOLOOVOO i da

hajde da o tome pišemo malo kasnije.
Zašto je ovo važno i zašto smo sve ovo napisali ovoliko visoko u oglasu? Zato
što smo hteli da odmah znaš da se mega cimamo da ljudima bude dobro. Neki

Sve ima veze i sa tim što rastemo drugačije od drugih. Od početka imamo jednog
klijenta, nemamo sales i ne tražimo druge. Ideja je da, umesto da često
menjamo projekte i često počinjemo iz početka i često se prilagođavamo ovom i
onom, HOOLOOVOO raste kroz Kindred. Posle cele 2020. i svega što je donela,
sigurni smo da je model jednog ovoliko velikog klijenta zdrav i da ima logike.
 Frontend
Backend smo podelili u mikroservise i to skaliramo, to je ok – veliki broj
mikroservisa znači veliki broj funkcionalnosti i veliki broj timova koji non-
stop isporučuju nove.
   Kako onda skalabilan frontend?
   Kako da ga podelimo u nezavisne timove?
   Kako da svi oni mogu da release-uju svoje izmene?
   Kako da frontend isporučuje funkcionalnosti istom dinamikom kao backend?

U Kindredu nam dosta veruju i oslanjaju se na nas i mi dosta verujemo njima.
Gajimo prijateljski i profesionalan odnos. Lepo je što je sve uređeno,
definisani su procesi i procedure su jasne i nema stresa. Ima, nema mnogo.
Nema mikromenadžmenta.
Vodimo računa o ljudima zato da ne moraju da brinu bukvalno ni o čemu, da
imaju mir i fokus, da im ništa ne fali, da mogu da rade i da uživaju. Da
završe posao, odu kući i više ne misle o poslu.
Još nešto. Jasno nam je da odlično programiraš i da si odličan čovek, ali i da
si upravo to – čovek i da ti tu i tamo treba neko da ti pomogne. Da te podrži
kad bi da napustiš zonu komfora i naučiš nešto novo, kad bi da staneš jako uz
neku svoju ideju. Da ti kaže da usporiš kad previše trošiš sebe tamo gde možda
ne moraš.
 Autonomija timova
Zaslužili smo veliko poverenje klijenta, zato rastemo. Pre nekog vremena, kad
smo shvatili da ćemo uvećati broj zaposlenih, brinuli smo o jednoj stvari: šta
ako porastemo i onda HOOLOOVOO izgubi sve ono što u ovom trenutku jeste – šta
ako postanemo korporacija ili počnemo da ličimo na neku i kako da se to ne
desi? Ovo je ona priča s početka.
Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bismo učinili timove autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine
smo uveli timski budžet. Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i
zavisi od broja članova tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team
building, edukacija, stave pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.
 Benefiti
Napisali smo ozbiljan tekst o benefitima u HOOLOOVOO-u (link). Malo je duži,
ne previše, ali onda ćeš znati sve o odmorima, o bolovanjima, o timskim
budžetima… Verovatno najvažniji segmenti tiču se zdravstvenog paketa, paketa
za trudnice ukoliko planiraš bebu i paketa koji kači slobodno vreme.

Senior Software Engineer (JS/Web Extensions),"JavaScript, HTML",Beograd,"CPA Global, Part of Clarivate","Clarivate™ is a global leader in providing solutions to accelerate the
lifecycle of innovation. Our bold mission is to help customers solve some of
the world’s most complex problems by providing actionable information and
insights that reduce the time from new ideas to life-changing inventions in
the areas of science and intellectual property. We help customers discover,
protect and commercialize their inventions using our trusted subscription and
technology-based solutions coupled with deep domain expertise.
We now have more than 8,500 colleagues in over 40 countries worldwide, and we
work with over 200 partners to deliver value and success for our customers.
Today, Clarivate is a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker NYSE:CLVT.
Clarivate is committed to building, nurturing, and developing a diverse
culture of belonging where new colleagues can bring their authentic self to
work every day! Join us!
The EndNote suite of tools help millions of people around the world access,
organise and publish their research.
 Our Team
   We're a small and highly talented team. We aim to accelerate the speed at which research is undertaken and published. We take pride in our culture where a 'can do' attitude is more valued than any process. We like to follow our curiosity and push boundaries. We put a strong emphasis on working independently and creatively, finding solutions to complex problems in an iterative way.
 The Role
   As a senior software engineer you will become an integral part of our small and highly talented team. You’ll be joining our team to improve reliability and performance and add new features to our products. We encourage people to work across streams, but your focus will be the EndNote Click browser extension which serves over 1 Million people.
   Working closely alongside Product and UX, you will play a central role in building the future of our products and exploring the technologies we use. We are looking for a user focused software engineer passionate about building EndNote in a way that enables end-users to conduct and publish their research.
   Our developer experience is super important too, so building a maintainable codebase that’s fun to work with is part of the agenda too!
 What we don’t require
   Our suite of products that use web technology include websites, browser extensions, bookmarklets, and plugins for word processors. Most engineers we’ve hired have been brand new to most of these. We’ve gotten pretty good at getting engineers up to speed quickly, so all you need is a solid foundation in web technologies (i.e. JavaScript, HTML, etc.).
 Cool things you'll be working on
   Most of our products touch the lives of millions of people. For example, there aren’t many engineers that have built browser extensions that reach large audiences. That means that a lot of the challenges we face are new and are often unique. If you like being creative and solving problems this role is likely a good fit.
   You’ll be working on both maintenance and feature development (likely in that order to start) of the EndNote Click browser extension. We hope you’ll want to take a step back and think about big-picture solutions. We'd want you to participate in discussions about the future of the projects, e.g. WebAssembly could help us, or evaluating changes in Chrome API's or rethinking approaches to debugging.
 Requirements
   You value a culture where the quality of code (maintainability, extensibility, performance) is as important as time-to-market
   A big picture focus when developing new applications and features
   A love for learning new things and applying them to your work
   10+ years experience developing, releasing and maintaining complex JavaScript applications
   Comfortable with version control systems (we use git)
   Excellent written and spoken English
 Day-to-day responsibilities
   Working with a small team to see how we can leverage web technologies as we push EndNote toward the future
   Continue our effort to push toward a fast, beautiful, maintainable, portable codebase across our suite of products
   Design and deploy analytics to see how code is performing and being used in the wild
   Writing unit tests where they add value, and removing or updating those that do not
 What We Can Offer You
   Paid lunch
   Private health insurance
   FitPass card
   Company bicycles for rent free of charge
   Access to My Learning platform
   Access to Virgin Pulse platform

 HOOLOOVOO raste!
U proteklih godinu dana i malo preko (od 1. juna 2020. godine), zaposlili smo
više od 40 novih kolega. Više od polovine – seniora. Sve ovo što HOOLOOVOO
jeste i ceo model poslovanja i cela stabilnost kojom se hvalimo, sve to je
bilo na testu prošle godine i taj test smo prošli bolje nego što smo mogli da
zamislimo (link). Nastavljamo da rastemo i to je strava, mada rast nosi neke
momente o kojima dosta razmišljamo – kako da HOOLOOVOO ostane HOOLOOVOO i da
ne postane korporacija. To nikako nećemo. Odgovor je autonomija timova, ali
hajde da o tome pišemo malo kasnije.
Zašto je ovo važno i zašto smo sve ovo napisali ovoliko visoko u oglasu? Zato
što smo hteli da odmah znaš da se mega cimamo da ljudima bude dobro. Neki
ljudi koji su bili ovde kad je HOOLOOVOO počinjao, još uvek su ovde, a
kapacitet su da odu gde god požele. O benefitima i sličnim stvarima pročitaćeš
za minut.
Sve ima veze i sa tim što rastemo drugačije od drugih. Od početka imamo jednog
klijenta, nemamo sales i ne tražimo druge. Ideja je da, umesto da često
menjamo projekte i često počinjemo iz početka i često se prilagođavamo ovom i
onom, HOOLOOVOO raste kroz Kindred. Posle cele 2020. i svega što je donela,
sigurni smo da je model jednog ovoliko velikog klijenta zdrav i da ima logike.
 Frontend
Backend smo podelili u mikroservise i to skaliramo, to je ok – veliki broj
mikroservisa znači veliki broj funkcionalnosti i veliki broj timova koji non-
stop isporučuju nove.
   Kako onda skalabilan frontend?
   Kako da ga podelimo u nezavisne timove?
   Kako da svi oni mogu da release-uju svoje izmene?
   Kako da frontend isporučuje funkcionalnosti istom dinamikom kao backend?
Tech Stack: React. Javascript.
 Support
U Kindredu nam dosta veruju i oslanjaju se na nas i mi dosta verujemo njima.
Gajimo prijateljski i profesionalan odnos. Lepo je što je sve uređeno,
definisani su procesi i procedure su jasne i nema stresa. Ima, nema mnogo.
Nema mikromenadžmenta.
Vodimo računa o ljudima zato da ne moraju da brinu bukvalno ni o čemu, da
imaju mir i fokus, da im ništa ne fali, da mogu da rade i da uživaju. Da
završe posao, odu kući i više ne misle o poslu.
Još nešto. Jasno nam je da odlično programiraš i da si odličan čovek, ali i da
si upravo to – čovek i da ti tu i tamo treba neko da ti pomogne. Da te podrži
kad bi da napustiš zonu komfora i naučiš nešto novo, kad bi da staneš jako uz
neku svoju ideju. Da ti kaže da usporiš kad previše trošiš sebe tamo gde možda
ne moraš.
 Autonomija timova
Zaslužili smo veliko poverenje klijenta, zato rastemo. Pre nekog vremena, kad
smo shvatili da ćemo uvećati broj zaposlenih, brinuli smo o jednoj stvari: šta
ako porastemo i onda HOOLOOVOO izgubi sve ono što u ovom trenutku jeste – šta
ako postanemo korporacija ili počnemo da ličimo na neku i kako da se to ne
desi? Ovo je ona priča s početka.
Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bismo učinili timove autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine
smo uveli timski budžet. Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i
zavisi od broja članova tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team
building, edukacija, stave pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.
 Benefiti
Napisali smo ozbiljan tekst o benefitima u HOOLOOVOO-u (link). Malo je duži,
ne previše, ali onda ćeš znati sve o odmorima, o bolovanjima, o timskim
budžetima… Verovatno najvažniji segmenti tiču se zdravstvenog paketa, paketa
za trudnice ukoliko planiraš bebu i paketa koji kači slobodno vreme.
PRIJAVI SE!
Ako si razmišljao/la o promeni posla ili ti se nekad učinilo da je HOOLOOVOO
mesto gde bi mogao/la da radiš neke super stvari, sad je trenutak da nam se

HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bismo učinili timove autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine
smo uveli timski budžet. Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i
zavisi od broja članova tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team
building, edukacija, stave pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.
 Benefiti
Napisali smo ozbiljan tekst o benefitima u HOOLOOVOO-u (link). Malo je duži,
ne previše, ali onda ćeš znati sve o odmorima, o bolovanjima, o timskim

Big Data Developer,"AWS, Docker, Java, Kafka, Scala, Spring, SQL",Beograd,HOOLOOVOO,"HOOLOOVOO traži nekog ko ume Javu ili Scalu i Spark. I Spring Boot. Napisali
smo dalje u oglasu ceo tech stack. Tim broji 18 ljudi mid/senior nivoa, u
Beogradu radi pet - tri developera i dva DevOpsa. Tim je ključan za razvoj
responsible gaminga – Player Safety, Anti Money Laundering itd.
GDPR smo rešili. Realtime releasovi (quick approval, GitOps principals, K8s,
Jenkins). High quality secure code alati (peer core reviews, JaCoCo, SpotBugs,
SonarCube, X-Ray vulnerability scans). Sve te fensi stvari, strava tehnologije
i testna okruženja da na njima eksperimentišemo. Oglas je malo duži, ali šira
slika je ključ. Trebaće ti minut-dva, a važno je da pročitaš ceo tekst.
 HOOLOOVOO RASTE!
U proteklih godinu dana i malo preko (od 1. juna 2020. godine), zaposlili smo
više od 40 novih kolega. Više od polovine – seniora. Sve ovo što HOOLOOVOO
jeste i ceo model poslovanja i cela stabilnost kojom se hvalimo, sve to je
bilo na testu prošle godine i taj test smo prošli bolje nego što smo mogli da
zamislimo (link). Nastavljamo da rastemo i to je strava, mada rast nosi neke
momente o kojima dosta razmišljamo – kako da HOOLOOVOO ostane HOOLOOVOO i da
ne postane korporacija. To nikako nećemo. Odgovor je autonomija timova, ali
hajde da o tome pišemo malo kasnije.
Zašto je ovo važno i zašto smo sve ovo napisali ovoliko visoko u oglasu? Zato
što smo hteli da odmah znaš da se mega cimamo da ljudima bude dobro. Neki
ljudi koji su bili ovde kad je HOOLOOVOO počinjao, još uvek su ovde, a
kapacitet su da odu gde god požele. O benefitima i sličnim stvarima pročitaćeš
za minut.
Sve ima veze i sa tim što rastemo drugačije od drugih. Od početka imamo jednog
klijenta, nemamo sales i ne tražimo druge. Ideja je da, umesto da često
menjamo projekte i često počinjemo iz početka i često se prilagođavamo ovom i
onom, HOOLOOVOO raste kroz Kindred. Posle cele 2020. i svega što je donela,
sigurni smo da je model jednog ovoliko velikog klijenta zdrav i da ima logike.
 Big Data
Dizajniramo i razvijamo realtime & batch data processing sisteme. Održavamo i
unapređujemo data pipeline zadužen za brzo procesiranje eventova i bezbedno
skladištenje podataka u data-lake. Optimizujemo aplikacije da efikasno koriste
resurse, smanje troškove i pritisak na druge komponente. Alerts setting &
tracking. Pratimo ceo lifecycle komponenti, obezbeđujemo visok availability i
fault tolerance za ceo pipeline flow. Ovo je verovatno oglas u kom smo
napisali najviše ovih engleskih reči… Lifecycle… Nema veze.
Tech Stack: Java ili Scala. Spark. AWS, Kafka, Docker/K8s. Spring Boot.
Hadoop. SQL.
 SUPPORT
U Kindredu nam dosta veruju i oslanjaju se na nas i mi dosta verujemo njima.
Gajimo prijateljski i profesionalan odnos. Lepo je što je sve uređeno,
definisani su procesi i procedure su jasne i nema stresa. Ima, nema mnogo.
Nema mikromenadžmenta.
Vodimo računa o ljudima zato da ne moraju da brinu bukvalno ni o čemu, da
imaju mir i fokus, da im ništa ne fali, da mogu da rade i da uživaju. Da
završe posao, odu kući i više ne misle o poslu.
Još nešto. Jasno nam je da odlično programiraš i da si odličan čovek, ali i da
si upravo to – čovek i da ti tu i tamo treba neko da ti pomogne. Da te podrži
kad bi da napustiš zonu komfora i naučiš nešto novo, kad bi da staneš jako uz
neku svoju ideju. Da ti kaže da usporiš kad previše trošiš sebe tamo gde možda
ne moraš.
 AUTONOMIJA TIMOVA
Zaslužili smo veliko poverenje klijenta, zato rastemo. Pre nekog vremena, kad
smo shvatili da ćemo uvećati broj zaposlenih, brinuli smo o jednoj stvari: šta
ako porastemo i onda HOOLOOVOO izgubi sve ono što u ovom trenutku jeste – šta
ako postanemo korporacija ili počnemo da ličimo na neku i kako da se to ne
desi? Ovo je ona priča s početka.
Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bolje razumeš sve i da razumeš ovu ilustraciju, pročitaj tekst (link) koji
je u stvari osnova HOOLOOVOO-a i Framework. Da bismo učinili timove
autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine smo uveli timski budžet.

Senior Software Engineer (JS/Web Extensions),"JavaScript, HTML",Beograd,"CPA Global, Part of Clarivate","Clarivate™ is a global leader in providing solutions to accelerate the
lifecycle of innovation. Our bold mission is to help customers solve some of
the world’s most complex problems by providing actionable information and
insights that reduce the time from new ideas to life-changing inventions in
the areas of science and intellectual property. We help customers discover,
protect and commercialize their inventions using our trusted subscription and
technology-based solutions coupled with deep domain expertise.
We now have more than 8,500 colleagues in over 40 countries worldwide, and we
work with over 200 partners to deliver value and success for our customers.
Today, Clarivate is a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker NYSE:CLVT.
Clarivate is committed to building, nurturing, and developing a diverse
culture of belonging where new colleagues can bring their authentic self to
work every day! Join us!
The EndNote suite of tools help millions of people around the world access,
organise and publish their research.
 Our Team
   We're a small and highly talented team. We aim to accelerate the speed at which research is undertaken and published. We take pride in our culture where a 'can do' attitude is more valued than any process. We like to follow our curiosity and push boundaries. We put a strong emphasis on working independently and creatively, finding solutions to complex problems in an iterative way.
 The Role
   As a senior software engineer you will become an integral part of our small and highly talented team. You’ll be joining our team to improve reliability and performance and add new features to our products. We encourage people to work across streams, but your focus will be the EndNote Click browser extension which serves over 1 Million people.
   Working closely alongside Product and UX, you will play a central role in building the future of our products and exploring the technologies we use. We are looking for a user focused software engineer passionate about building EndNote in a way that enables end-users to conduct and publish their research.
   Our developer experience is super important too, so building a maintainable codebase that’s fun to work with is part of the agenda too!
 What we don’t require
   Our suite of products that use web technology include websites, browser extensions, bookmarklets, and plugins for word processors. Most engineers we’ve hired have been brand new to most of these. We’ve gotten pretty good at getting engineers up to speed quickly, so all you need is a solid foundation in web technologies (i.e. JavaScript, HTML, etc.).
 Cool things you'll be working on
   Most of our products touch the lives of millions of people. For example, there aren’t many engineers that have built browser extensions that reach large audiences. That means that a lot of the challenges we face are new and are often unique. If you like being creative and solving problems this role is likely a good fit.
   You’ll be working on both maintenance and feature development (likely in that order to start) of the EndNote Click browser extension. We hope you’ll want to take a step back and think about big-picture solutions. We'd want you to participate in discussions about the future of the projects, e.g. WebAssembly could help us, or evaluating changes in Chrome API's or rethinking approaches to debugging.
 Requirements
   You value a culture where the quality of code (maintainability, extensibility, performance) is as important as time-to-market
   A big picture focus when developing new applications and features
   A love for learning new things and applying them to your work
   10+ years experience developing, releasing and maintaining complex JavaScript applications
   Comfortable with version control systems (we use git)
   Excellent written and spoken English
 Day-to-day responsibilities
   Working with a small team to see how we can leverage web technologies as we push EndNote toward the future
   Continue our effort to push toward a fast, beautiful, maintainable, portable codebase across our suite of products
   Design and deploy analytics to see how code is performing and being used in the wild
   Writing unit tests where they add value, and removing or updating those that do not

jeste i ceo model poslovanja i cela stabilnost kojom se hvalimo, sve to je
bilo na testu prošle godine i taj test smo prošli bolje nego što smo mogli da
zamislimo (link). Nastavljamo da rastemo i to je strava, mada rast nosi neke
momente o kojima dosta razmišljamo – kako da HOOLOOVOO ostane HOOLOOVOO i da
ne postane korporacija. To nikako nećemo. Odgovor je autonomija timova, ali
hajde da o tome pišemo malo kasnije.
Zašto je ovo važno i zašto smo sve ovo napisali ovoliko visoko u oglasu? Zato

Sve ima veze i sa tim što rastemo drugačije od drugih. Od početka imamo jednog

menjamo projekte i često počinjemo iz početka i često se prilagođavamo ovom i

 Frontend
Backend smo podelili u mikroservise i to skaliramo, to je ok – veliki broj
mikroservisa znači veliki broj funkcionalnosti i veliki broj timova koji non-
stop isporučuju nove.
   Kako onda skalabilan frontend?
   Kako da ga podelimo u nezavisne timove?
   Kako da svi oni mogu da release-uju svoje izmene?
   Kako da frontend isporučuje funkcionalnosti istom dinamikom kao backend?

U Kindredu nam dosta veruju i oslanjaju se na nas i mi dosta verujemo njima.
Gajimo prijateljski i profesionalan odnos. Lepo je što je sve uređeno,
definisani su procesi i procedure su jasne i nema stresa. Ima, nema mnogo.
Nema mikromenadžmenta.
Vodimo računa o ljudima zato da ne moraju da brinu bukvalno ni o čemu, da
imaju mir i fokus, da im ništa ne fali, da mogu da rade i da uživaju. Da
završe posao, odu kući i više ne misle o poslu.
Još nešto. Jasno nam je da odlično programiraš i da si odličan čovek, ali i da
si upravo to – čovek i da ti tu i tamo treba neko da ti pomogne. Da te podrži
kad bi da napustiš zonu komfora i naučiš nešto novo, kad bi da staneš jako uz
neku svoju ideju. Da ti kaže da usporiš kad previše trošiš sebe tamo gde možda
ne moraš.
 Autonomija timova
Zaslužili smo veliko poverenje klijenta, zato rastemo. Pre nekog vremena, kad
smo shvatili da ćemo uvećati broj zaposlenih, brinuli smo o jednoj stvari: šta
ako porastemo i onda HOOLOOVOO izgubi sve ono što u ovom trenutku jeste – šta
ako postanemo korporacija ili počnemo da ličimo na neku i kako da se to ne
desi? Ovo je ona priča s početka.
Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bismo učinili timove autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine
smo uveli timski budžet. Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i
zavisi od broja članova tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team
building, edukacija, stave pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.
 Benefiti

ne previše, ali onda ćeš znati sve o odmorima, o bolovanjima, o timskim
budžetima… Verovatno najvažniji segmenti tiču se zdravstvenog paketa, paketa

ljudi koji su bili ovde kad je HOOLOOVOO počinjao, još uvek su ovde, a
kapacitet su da odu gde god požele. O benefitima i sličnim stvarima pročitaćeš
za minut.
Sve ima veze i sa tim što rastemo drugačije od drugih. Od početka imamo jednog
klijenta, nemamo sales i ne tražimo druge. Ideja je da, umesto da često
menjamo projekte i često počinjemo iz početka i često se prilagođavamo ovom i
onom, HOOLOOVOO raste kroz Kindred. Posle cele 2020. i svega što je donela,
sigurni smo da je model jednog ovoliko velikog klijenta zdrav i da ima logike.
 Big Data
Dizajniramo i razvijamo realtime & batch data processing sisteme. Održavamo i
unapređujemo data pipeline zadužen za brzo procesiranje eventova i bezbedno
skladištenje podataka u data-lake. Optimizujemo aplikacije da efikasno koriste
resurse, smanje troškove i pritisak na druge komponente. Alerts setting &
tracking. Pratimo ceo lifecycle komponenti, obezbeđujemo visok availability i
fault tolerance za ceo pipeline flow. Ovo je verovatno oglas u kom smo
napisali najviše ovih engleskih reči… Lifecycle… Nema veze.
Tech Stack: Java ili Scala. Spark. AWS, Kafka, Docker/K8s. Spring Boot.
Hadoop. SQL.
 SUPPORT
U Kindredu nam dosta veruju i oslanjaju se na nas i mi dosta verujemo njima.
Gajimo prijateljski i profesionalan odnos. Lepo je što je sve uređeno,
definisani su procesi i procedure su jasne i nema stresa. Ima, nema mnogo.
Nema mikromenadžmenta.
Vodimo računa o ljudima zato da ne moraju da brinu bukvalno ni o čemu, da
imaju mir i fokus, da im ništa ne fali, da mogu da rade i da uživaju. Da
završe posao, odu kući i više ne misle o poslu.
Još nešto. Jasno nam je da odlično programiraš i da si odličan čovek, ali i da
si upravo to – čovek i da ti tu i tamo treba neko da ti pomogne. Da te podrži
kad bi da napustiš zonu komfora i naučiš nešto novo, kad bi da staneš jako uz
neku svoju ideju. Da ti kaže da usporiš kad previše trošiš sebe tamo gde možda
ne moraš.
 AUTONOMIJA TIMOVA
Zaslužili smo veliko poverenje klijenta, zato rastemo. Pre nekog vremena, kad
smo shvatili da ćemo uvećati broj zaposlenih, brinuli smo o jednoj stvari: šta
ako porastemo i onda HOOLOOVOO izgubi sve ono što u ovom trenutku jeste – šta
ako postanemo korporacija ili počnemo da ličimo na neku i kako da se to ne
desi? Ovo je ona priča s početka.
Ključni odgovor je autonomija timova, gde je svaki tim u stvari mali
HOOLOOVOO. Osnovna ideja je poverenje. Delivery ne ispašta ako pustiš ljude da
rade kako misle da treba, ako poštuješ njihov rad i njihove odluke. Naprotiv.
Da bolje razumeš sve i da razumeš ovu ilustraciju, pročitaj tekst (link) koji
je u stvari osnova HOOLOOVOO-a i Framework. Da bismo učinili timove
autonomnim, pa i u finansijskom smislu, prošle godine smo uveli timski budžet.
Svakog meseca tim prihoduje neki iznos (različit je i zavisi od broja članova
tima) i može da troši taj novac kako god hoće. Team building, edukacija, stave
pare u džep, šta god… HOOLOOVOO se u to ne meša.
 BENEFITI
Napisali smo ozbiljan tekst o benefitima u HOOLOOVOO-u (link). Malo je duži,
ne previše, ali onda ćeš znati sve o odmorima, o bolovanjima, o timskim
budžetima… Verovatno najvažniji segmenti tiču se zdravstvenog paketa, paketa
za trudnice ukoliko planiraš bebu i paketa koji kači slobodno vreme.
 PRIJAVI SE!
Ako si razmišljao/la o promeni posla ili ti se nekad učinilo da je HOOLOOVOO
mesto gde bi mogao/la da radiš neke super stvari, sad je trenutak da nam se
javiš. Piši nam mail na pokidaj@hooloovoo.rs. Trebaš nam.",https://www.joberty.rs/posao/big-data-developer/hooloovoo/7632

Tvoje primarne odgovornosti na ovoj poziciji su dizajniranje, pisanje i
održavanje koda u C programskom jeziku i koordinacija sa ostatkom tima koji
radi na različitim fazama projekta.
Verujemo da su naš glavni benefit ljudi i projekti. Pod ljudima smatramo sve
odnose između tima, kvalitet i znanje zaposlenih kao i spremnost da se pomogne
u svakoj situaciji. Naš tim je mlad, sa prisustvom dovoljno iskusnih seniora,
koji su tu da vode i prenose znanje i od kojih se može mnogo naučiti. Projekti
na kojima radimo su naši, rade se od nule i ne nasleđujemo ničiji kod. Ne
postoje situacije kada moraš da ispravljaš tuđi kod ili da analiziraš šta je
urađeno. Projekti su za velike klijente i rade se da bi ih koristio veliki
broj ljudi. Radimo bez pritiska, tenzije i kratkih rokova.

zapošljavamo ljude za koje smatramo da će se uklopiti sa ostatkom tima.

Tvoje primarne odgovornosti na ovoj poziciji su dizajniranje, pisanje i
održavanje koda u C programskom jeziku i koordinacija sa ostatkom tima koji
radi na različitim fazama projekta.
Verujemo da su naš glavni benefit ljudi i projekti. Pod ljudima smatramo sve
odnose između tima, kvalitet i znanje zaposlenih kao i spremnost da se pomogne
u svakoj situaciji. Naš tim je mlad, sa prisustvom dovoljno iskusnih seniora,
koji su tu da vode i prenose znanje i od kojih se može mnogo naučiti. Projekti
na kojima radimo su naši, rade se od nule i ne nasleđujemo ničiji kod. Ne
postoje situacije kada moraš da ispravljaš tuđi kod ili da analiziraš šta je
urađeno. Projekti su za velike klijente i rade se da bi ih koristio veliki
broj ljudi. Radimo bez pritiska, tenzije i kratkih rokova.

   Fleksibilni smo po pitanju odmora i slobodnih dana
   Imaš priliku da u slobodno vreme učiš i edukuješ se - što po našoj preporuci, tako možeš i sam/a naći šta želiš, tvoje učenje i rad na poboljšanju veština nam je skoro pa jednako važno kao i tvoj rad, jer zajedno moramo da učimo i rastemo

prijaju. Zbog toga, od prvog dana, pažljivo radimo na razvijanju i održavanju
atmosfere i kulture u firmi, a procesu selekcije pažljivo pristupamo i
zapošljavamo ljude za koje smatramo da će se uklopiti sa ostatkom tima.
